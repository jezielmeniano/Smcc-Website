        <h1>About SMCC</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Founded in 1948, Saint Michael College of Caraga (SMCC) in Nasipit, Philippines, has evolved from its early years 
                under Dutch priests to becoming a thriving educational institution. Originally initiated to address the need 
                for a secondary school,  it has grown to encompass various levels of education.</li>
                <br>
            <li>
                The transition to layman leadership occurred in 1975, marking a shift in governance. Over the years, 
                SMCC expanded its academic offerings and facilities, responding to the changing educational landscape. 
                The college department was recognized for its excellence, earning accolades and awards.

                In 2002, the institution underwent a name change, becoming Saint Michael College of Caraga. Under the 
                leadership of Msgr. Bienvenido A. Betaizar, the school experienced further expansion, including the 
                opening of the Grade School department and the College Department with Technical Courses.

                include the inauguration of a four-storey building in 2005 and the certification of ISO 9001:2015 in 2018, 
                making SMCC the first school in the Diocese of Butuan with ISO certification.
